known-issues:
-after vocabularies-update settings don't refresh themselves.
    -> may cause total crash which can only be solved by deleting the settings in the android-app-settings
-it seems to be necessary, that every vocabulary has at least one character != ' ' in the "character"-field,
    probably freezes and/or crashes otherwise
-in newer versions, maybe with higher SDK-versions(?), it takes very long to go from settings to the learn-mode (to the VocabularyTrainer activity)
-in newer versions, maybe with higher SDK-versions(?), it takes very long to change the language in settings (maybe because string-translations are incomplete?)

todo:


-----------------------new features-----------------------
- add feature to move vocabularies into another box
- add feature to modify a vocabulary, e.g. to correct a typo
- show text field + switch instead of canvas
- support sftp
- show success or fail after update of the vocabularies
- implement stats such as how many vocabularies in which box
- allow white space in vocabularies.txt
- show good error message if vocabularies-list is incorrect
- add feature to change the path of the vocabularies-list for reading input file
- add feature to change the path of the vocabularies-list for writing backup file
- show warning when overwriting backup file
- show progress bar while reading vocabularies-list at program start
- show progress bar while reading vocabularies-list in WarningReadVocabularies
- show progress bar while updating vocabularies


------------------------usability-------------------------
- make start without vocabularies-list but with example vocabularies instead possible
- change vocabulary-boxes names from -2-+2 to 1-5
- allow user comments e.g. a book legend in the vocabulary-list
    -e.g.:  #book 1 = "Chinese Learning A1"
            #book 2 = "Chinese Learning A2"
    -should also be saved in the database and later in the backup vocabularies list
        -should probably associated with a book and lesson to write them later at the same place automatically
            -explicit or maybe better depending on the next vocabulary
- improve colors for better readability
- catch landscape
- complete existing translations
- add new translations
- simplify user interface, improve explanations
- nicer drawing
- improve warning-message when program starts without vocabularies-list (not necessary anymore if program starts without vocabularies-list)
- improve warning-message when program starts with incorrect vocabularies-list (not necessary anymore if program starts without vocabularies-list)
- show result after write-vocabularies (success/failed)



-----------------documentation and manual-----------------
- readme
- implement in-App manual
    -short explanation of usage
    -links to known bugs and to-do-list (this file)
- info: add contact-information and github-path
- translate last german code-comments
- better code-documentation
- upload of an example-vocabularies-list


-----------------------performance------------------------
- probably improve reading/saving of the vocabularies-lists


---------------------------else---------------------------
- refactoring
- source out last hard-coded strings
- write language into prefs after first(?) start of the program
- publish on F-Droid
- publish on Play-Store
- save version at only one place (not in all strings.xml, AndroidManifest.xml and ???)
